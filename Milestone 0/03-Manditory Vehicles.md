# Mandatory Use of Government-Wide Contracts for Commercial Items
Government agencies are required to use existing contracts instead of creating new contracts when buying commercial products.

If a product is already available through a government-wide contract, agencies must use that contract.

Most software purchases (like SaaS) will be made through Task Orders/Delivery Orders under large contract agreements (IDIQs, GWACs, MAS).
