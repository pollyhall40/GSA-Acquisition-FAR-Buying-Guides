# Forking vs. Pull Requests: What’s the Difference?

✅ TL;DR:

**Forking** → Makes a personal copy of the content.
- You can freely make changes to this forked repo without affecting the original.

- When you’re ready to suggest changes to the original, you can submit a pull request.

**Pull Request ("PR")** → Submits your changes for review and merging into the original.
- You "request" the original project owner to "pull" in your changes.

- The owner can review, comment, and either approve or reject your changes.

# When to Use Each
**Forking:**

- When you want to experiment, test, or modify code without affecting the original.

- When you don’t have write access to the original repo.

- When you want your own copy for independent development.

**Pull Request:**

- When you want to submit improvements, fixes, or new features to the original project.

- When you want your changes to be reviewed and merged.

- For collaborative development.

**_You don't always have to fork, but you always have to submit a pull request_**

💡 **Real-World Example**

1. Fork the content → You now have your own version to make changes freely.

2. Make changes → Add new information, guidance, tips, improvements or typos in your fork.

3. Create a pull request → Suggest your changes to the original project.

4. GSA Team Reviews → They review, request changes (if needed), or approve your PR.

5. If the PR is approved, the PR is merged → Your changes become part of the original project.


# **Tips for Effective Pull Requests (PRs)**

To make the **pull request (PR) process faster, clearer, and more effective**, here are some tips for **requesters** (the person suggesting changes) . Following these tips will help everyone **save time, reduce confusion, and make better decisions**.

## **For Requesters: Submitting a Pull Request**

1️⃣ **Be Clear and Specific**
- Clearly **describe what your PR does**.  
- Include a concise summary of the problem it solves or the improvement it makes.  
- Example:  
   ✅ `Fixes typo in section 2` → **Clear and direct**.  
   ❌ `Small changes` → **Vague and unhelpful**.  

2️⃣ **Use Meaningful Titles**
- Your PR title should describe the change accurately.  
- Examples:  
   - `Add clarification to SaaS pricing considerations`  
   - `Correct grammar in section 3.1`  
   - `Provides a checklist for security implementation`

3️⃣ **Add Context and Justification**
- Explain **why the change is necessary**.  
- Provide examples or references if possible.  
- Provide examples where the suggested update has proven successful in a procurement.

4️⃣ **Keep PRs Small and Focused**
- Submit **one PR per topic or fix**.  
- Large, multi-purpose PRs are harder to review.  
- If making multiple changes, consider creating separate PRs.  

5️⃣ **Use Clear and Consistent Formatting**
- Use consistent **Markdown formatting** for readability.  
- Apply lists, bullet points, and headers when applicable.  
- Example:  
   ```markdown
   ## Changes Made
   - Fixed typo in section 2.3  
   - Added example for clarity  
   ```
