# Show, don't tell: Smart Evaluation Approaches for SaaS

Traditional written proposals often fail to reveal how well a SaaS solution performs in real-world conditions. Instead, use **challenge-based** and **demo-driven** evaluation methods that ask vendors to **prove their capabilities live**, using agency-specific scenarios and actual end-user feedback. This approach enables buyers to more accurately, meaningfully assess a solution's value and usability.

## 🔍 Challenge-based Evaluation

- Start with business problems, not technical specs.

- Frame the requirement around **mission outcomes**, not features.

  ✅ *Example*: "Reduce time to process benefit claims by 50%."
  
  🚫 *Avoid*: "Must include batch processing feature."

- Describe:
  - Current state and desired future state.
  - Defined performance metrics and business outcomes.
  - Constraints such as data security, integration points, or implementation timelines.

- Evaluate based on **solution effectiveness**, not adherence to a checklist of technical specs.

## 🎯 Demonstration-based Evaluation

- Replace lengthy written proposals with standardized solution demos.

- Require vendors to:
  - Present **live demo** using predefined agency-specific scenarios.
  - Configure the SaaS solution to reflect realistic use cases.
  - Show how the solution integrates with sample data or systems.

- Evaluation guidance:
  - Involve actual end users on the evaluation panel.
  - Use a scoring rubric focused on elements such as:
    - How well the solution solves the challenge.
    - Ease of use and intuitive design.
    - Ability to adapt to agency workflows.
   
## 🧪 Design Effective Evaluation Scenarios

Build scenarios based on actual agency use cases, such as:

- Data entry or analysis workflows.
- Communication or approval processes.
- User onboarding and training experience.

Provide sample data and ask vendors to show:

- How the solution handles real inputs.
- How easily users can complete tasks.
- How dashboards, notifications, and integrations work in context.

## 🧍 Involve the Right People

- Include end users, program staff, and IT stakeholders on the evaluation panel.
- Have evaluators focus on efficiency, intuitiveness, and how well the solution supports the mission.

## 🧠 Evaluate Based on Performance and Fit

- Evaluate the SaaS capabilities, don't just check boxes on software functionality. 

- Evaluate:
  - Real-world effectiveness.
  - Configurability (remember, instead of custom coding).
  - Vendor experience with similar implementations.
  - Proven results with measurable outcomes.
  - Discriminating vendor SLAs.

## 📣 Let Vendors Show Why Their SaaS Works

- Ask for case studies with before/after metrics.
- Encourage vendors to highlight how and why their approach works for the agency—not just list or describe features.
