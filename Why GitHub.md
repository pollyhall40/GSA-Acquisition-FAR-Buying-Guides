# Procurement Buying Guides Content Repository

Welcome! This GitHub repository is a place for collaboration and feedback on procurement buying guides. If you're new to GitHub, don't worry—this space isn't for coding. Instead, we use it to transparently develop content that helps federal buyers make informed decisions.

## The Future Tech-Enabled Site
This is just the beginning. Eventually, this content will be part of a dynamic, user-friendly website designed to help federal buyers quickly find, understand, and apply procurement guidance. The future site will:
- Provide an intuitive search experience so users can get answers fast.
- Offer interactive tools to streamline decision-making.
- Continuously evolve based on user feedback and data.

By refining content here in GitHub, we ensure the future site is built on clear, practical, and user-tested guidance. Your input now helps shape a resource that will serve the entire acquisition community more effectively.

## What This Repository Is For
- **Hosting procurement buying guide content** – Not code!
- **Gathering feedback** from the acquisition community.
- **Improving clarity and usefulness** of buying guidance before it goes live on a tech-enabled website.

## Why GitHub?
We want an open and interactive way to develop this content. GitHub allows us to:
- Share drafts of procurement guides.
- Collect comments and suggestions from the acquisition community.
- Track updates and improvements over time.

## How You Can Participate
1. **Read the content** – Explore the guides in this repository.
2. **Share feedback** – Open an issue or add comments to suggest improvements.
3. **Stay involved** – Follow the updates as we refine the content.
