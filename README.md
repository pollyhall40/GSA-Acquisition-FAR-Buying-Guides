# Buying Guides Content Repository

Welcome! This GitHub repository is a place for collaboration and feedback on procurement buying guides. If you're new to GitHub, don't worry - this space isn't for coding. Instead, we use it to transparently develop content _**iteratively**_ that helps federal buyers make informed decisions.

## The Future Tech-Enabled Site
This is just the beginning. Eventually, this content will be part of a dynamic, user-friendly website designed to help federal buyers quickly find, understand, and apply procurement guidance. The future site will:
- Provide an intuitive search experience so users can get answers fast.
- Offer interactive tools to streamline decision-making.
- Continuously evolve based on user feedback and data.

By refining content here in GitHub, we ensure the future site is built on clear, practical, and user-tested guidance. Your input now helps shape a resource that will serve the entire acquisition community more effectively.

## What This Repository Is For
- Hosting procurement buying guide content – Not code!
- Gathering feedback from the acquisition community.
- Improving clarity and usefulness of buying guidance before it goes live on a tech-enabled website.

## Why GitHub?
We want an open and interactive way to develop this content. GitHub allows us to:
- Share drafts of conent for buying guides.
- Collect comments and suggestions from the acquisition community.
- Track updates and improvements over time.
