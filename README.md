# **Welcome to Our GitHub Repository**

## 🚀 **What Is GitHub?**
GitHub is an online platform where we can **post, share, and collaborate on content in real time**. It allows anyone—including you—to **view our guidance, suggest changes, and help us improve** the information we provide. 

Think of it as a **shared online workspace** where collaboration is open and transparent.

---

## 🔥 **Why Are We Using GitHub?**
We’re using GitHub to:
- ✅ **Share information transparently**: All of our guidance is public, so anyone can view it anytime.  
- 💡 **Improve through public input**: You can suggest changes by submitting a "pull request," helping us refine and strengthen the content.  
- ⚡ **Collaborate efficiently**: GitHub makes it easy to review, discuss, and adopt improvements in a streamlined way.

## 💡 **How Does It Work?**

Here’s a simple breakdown of how you can interact with our content:

### 1️⃣ **Viewing Content**
- When you visit our GitHub repository, you’ll see files containing our guidance.  
- You can click on any file to read its contents.  

### 2️⃣ **Suggesting Changes**
If you want to suggest an improvement:
- Click the ✏️ **"Edit"** button on the file (you’ll need a GitHub account to do this).  
- Make your suggested edits.  
- Submit a **pull request**: This sends us your proposed change for review.  
- Our team will review your suggestion and either:
   - ✅ **Adopt it** (pull it into the main content), or  
   - ❌ **Reject it** (if it doesn’t fit the current needs).  

### 3️⃣ **Staying Informed**
- You can "watch" or "star" the repository to **stay updated** on new content or changes.  
- You can also view the **commit history** to see how the content evolves over time.

### 4️⃣ **How We Will Prioritize Pull Requests**
- This buying guide is for the government acquisition workforce.
- We will prioritize pull requests in GitHub from users with @gov accounts over those with non-gov accounts, as government users are our primary audience for the buying guide. We welcome ideas and suggestions from everyone, but we want to be clear about how we prioritize contributions.
