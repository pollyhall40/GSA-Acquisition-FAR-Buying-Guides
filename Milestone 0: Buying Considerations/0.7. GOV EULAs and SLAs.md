# Rely on Government-wide EULAs and SLAs

Government-wide End User License Agreements (EULAs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) simplify acquisitions by ensuring consistent terms and performance expectations across contracts.

- **EULAs**: The government negotiates these agreements to align with U.S. laws while staying close to commercial practices. They cover terms like data rights, warranties, returns, software updates, and dispute resolution for software licenses or SaaS subscriptions.  

- **SLAs**: These define performance metrics such as uptime and response times. They typically follow a vendor's commercial standards to keep costs low and maintain availability. SLAs also outline penalties (e.g., refunds, discounts) if performance falls short. Vendors usually apply the same SLAs across all their customers.

Agencies should rely on these standardized agreements but may create more terms if neededâ€”such as for critical systems that require higher performance or extra data protections. However, stricter SLAs beyond commercial norms can significantly drive up costs and reduce available options. For example, increasing uptime from 99% to 99.999% can cost millions due to added infrastructure, backups, and redundancies.

Cloud services like SaaS remain cost-effective because they use standardized setups and are deployed in one or limited configurations.
