# Path 2: Comprehensive Guidance for Complex SaaS Acquisitions

## SaaS customization in federal environments
SaaS is best when a team can use a commercial solution and doesn't need a customized solution. Don’t customize SaaS solutions. Doing so may create several significant risks and challenges outlined below. If configuring commercial SaaS solutions and making acceptable changes to business processes do not meet the requirements, get custom software development services.

## What's the difference between software configuration and customization?

| **Aspect** | **Software Configuration** | **Software Customization** |
|------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Definition | Adjusting built-in settings without changing the core software. | Changing the actual software code to create new features. |
| How It Works | Using available settings, toggles, and menus. | Writing new code or altering existing code. |
| Impact on Updates | Having vendor updates still work normally. | Having vendor updates break the custom features. |
| Examples | Setting user permissions, creating dashboards, defining workflow rules. | Building custom integrations, creating entirely new functions, altering core functionality. |

### Configuration vs. Customization

## Leave SaaS in the Cloud
Maintaining the intended cloud-based delivery of SaaS keeps things flexible, secure, and up to date. Moving cloud software to on-premise servers is risky. Doing so risks non-value-added extra costs, limits to scalability, delays in deploying vendor upgrades and enhancements, and diminished security protections. 

## Compliance and Security Risks  
- **FedRAMP compliance issues:** Customizations may compromise the baseline security posture that earned FedRAMP authorization in the first place.  
- **Audit trail disruption:** Custom code may not maintain the same level of logging and monitoring as the core platform.  
- **Supply chain security:** Third-party customizations introduce more vendors into the security ecosystem.  
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities:** Custom code doesn't benefit from extensive security testing like the main platform.  

## Operational Challenges  
- **Upgrade complications:** Customizations often break during platform updates, creating "version lock" (when systems are stuck using old versions of software because custom changes won’t work with newer versions).  
- **Support limitations:** Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) may not support heavily customized implementations.  
- **Resource overhead:** Maintaining custom code requires dedicated resources and specialized knowledge, negating the advantages of commercial SaaS solutions.  

## Financial Implications  
- **Hidden costs:** Initial development costs often underestimate long-term maintenance costs and requirements.  
- **Diminished Return on Investment (ROI):** The total cost of ownership increases while benefits of the SaaS model decrease.  
- **Budget unpredictability:** Custom feature maintenance creates recurring, sometimes unexpected expenses.  

## Strategic Considerations  
- **Vendor lock-in:** Extensive customizations make migrating to alternative solutions more difficult.  
- **Platform divergence:** Custom implementations drift from the vendor's innovation roadmap.  
- **Technical debt:** Accumulated customizations create significant technical debt over time.  
- **Scalability constraints:** Custom components may not scale at the same rate as the core platform.
