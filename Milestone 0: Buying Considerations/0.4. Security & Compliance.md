# Security and Compliance as a Foundation

## Pre-Vendor Engagement Considerations

Before engaging with vendors, determine the required FedRAMP impact level to align with federal security standards. Assessing the following elements before issuing a solicitation helps mitigate risks and clarify responsibilities:

- Data ownership
- Data storage location
- Data encryption
- Data access rights
- Compliance requirements

Documentation of these requirements should include providing for:
- Continuous monitoring
- Security updates to maintain system compliance over time

## Exit Strategy and Data Management

### Key Considerations

- **Exit Strategy**: Define early to prevent vendor lock-in and ensure smooth transitions.
- **Data Extraction**: Specify formats and transition support upfront.
- **Post-Contract Data Access**: Ensure agencies maintain control over critical information.

### Vendor Obligations

Outlining vendor obligations for transition and knowledge transfer in the contract:
- Establishes clear expectations
- Reduces potential disruptions
- Ensures long-term operational resilience

## Government-Wide Contract Vehicle Approach

If a government-wide contract vehicle is established, address a common approach for data migration and exit at the vehicle level to ensure:
- Consistent standards
- Sound migration practices
- Uniform application across user agencies
