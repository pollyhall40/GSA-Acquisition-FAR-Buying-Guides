# What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** uses computing resources—like servers, storage, and applications—over the internet instead of owning and maintaining them yourself. It provides on-demand access to these resources, allowing users to scale up or down as needed, pay for what they use, and get services from anywhere with an Internet connection.

## Types of Cloud Services

There are three main types of cloud services:

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Ready-to-use applications, like email or document storage, that run in the cloud.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: A framework for developers to build and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Virtualized computing resources like storage and processing power that users can configure as needed.

## Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud computing can be used in different ways:

- **Private Cloud**: Used by a single organization.
- **Public Cloud**: Open to anyone, provided by companies like AWS or Google Cloud.
- **Community Cloud**: Shared by organizations with similar needs.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: A mix of two or more cloud types.

It's designed to be flexible, cost-efficient, and scalable while reducing the need for extensive IT management.

## What is SaaS?

SaaS is a commercial IT service that provides access to use the vendor's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessed from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. 

With the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings, the government does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or individual software application capabilities.
