# Drafting Assumptions

1. We drafted for web-publication (see techfarhub.cio.gov for a similar webpage look and feel). Later, we may enhance these guides into a broader AI-enabled end-to-end acquisition management system.

2. Statutory and prescriptive requirements that apply to all procurements will remain in the FAR Volume 1 (including cybersecurity, privacy, data rights). They are not included here. The intended audience for this guide are acquisition team members in the FAR System, including representatives from the technical and procurement teams and the customers they support.

3. We do not describe the overarching process that applies to most federal competitive procurements here. Rather, these category-specific buying guides focus on the unique aspects and considerations throughout the procurement process that apply specifically to acquiring products or services within the given category of spend.

4. This SaaS module is our prototype. As such, we may include guidance in this module that is more broadly relevant to IT buying. We do not plan to repeat this guidance across each module. Later, we will include common guidance within the overall IT buying guide.

5. We understand existing internal agency guidebooks on these topics may exist that this buying guide will inform. An example of such is the [DOD Cloud Acquisition Guidebook (DCAG)](https://www.dau.edu/tools/dod-cloud-acquisition-guidebook).

6. We will design the buying guides and associated sections to support interoperability with the regulatory overhaul that will be built around milestones in the acquisition lifecycle: **Pre-Solicitation > Solicitation / Evaluation / Award > Post Award**.

However, we plan to start each guide with a section on Important Category-Specific Buying Considerations, thus:

- **Milestone 0: Important Category-Specific Buying Considerations**
- **Milestone 1: Pre-Solicitation**
- **Milestone 2: Solicitation/Evaluation/Award**
- **Milestone 3: Post-Award**
- **Appendices**
