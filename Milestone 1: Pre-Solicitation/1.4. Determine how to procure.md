# Procurement strategy for SaaS solutions

Determine the most effective and compliant procurement strategy for acquiring the SaaS solution. Begin by evaluating whether the requirement meets the threshold for a small business set-aside under FAR Part 19. 

When appropriate, place orders through the GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS), which offers a wide range of SaaS products and enables set-asides at the task order level. 

For more capabilities or pricing advantages, explore other existing IT Category vehicles such as governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), Best-in-Class (BIC) solutions, or agency-specific enterprise license agreements. These pre-competed vehicles can offer streamlined acquisition processes, favorable terms, and pricing tailored for government use.
