# Building with the End in Mind

**Building with the end in mind** ensures your SaaS procurement prioritizes outcomes. Before drafting your bid, clearly define what success looks like for your agency and how the solution you choose will help achieve your agency's mission goals.

## Clarify Mission and Strategic Objectives

- What **core business needs** must the SaaS solution address?
- How does the solution support broader **agency IT strategies**, digital transformation goals, and policy alignment?
- Will it help modernize outdated processes or enhance service delivery?

## Define Success Metrics

- Gather and review service level agreements (SLAs) as part of your market research.
- Consider full software lifecycle costs, including licensing, renewals, data migration, and transition planning.
- Ensure the solution can scale with your agency's needs and remain flexible to accommodate future requirements without costly rework.

## Work Together to Prioritize Requirements 

- Work closely with end users and stakeholders to gather real needs and pain points.
- Use the **MoSCoW Method** to prioritize:
  - **Must** – Essential to success.
  - **Should** – Important but not critical.
  - **Could** – Beneficial if feasible.
  - **Won't** – Not needed for this procurement.
- Focus on business outcomes rather than feature lists.

## Identify Business Process Gaps

- Where do current processes break down or not work efficiently?
- Can we automate manual or repetitive tasks?
- Can the agency change business processes to use a SaaS solution without suffering adverse impacts?
- Can a SaaS solution enable process improvement or transformation?

By grounding your procurement in clear, prioritized business needs, you increase the likelihood that you will choose a solution that is **fit-for-purpose, scalable, and aligned with your agency's long-term mission.**
