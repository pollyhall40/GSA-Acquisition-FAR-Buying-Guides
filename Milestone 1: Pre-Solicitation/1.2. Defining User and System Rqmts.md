# Define user, data, and system requirements
Understanding who will use the system, how it will integrate with existing infrastructure, and how it will manage and protect sensitive data are essential for selecting a secure and scalable SaaS solution.

## User access & scope
- How many users will need access?
- Will the solution be used by one agency or many agencies?
- What roles or permission levels are required?
  
## Integration and interoperability
- Can the SaaS integrate with your agency’s existing systems and workflows?
- What APIs, connectors, or data structures are needed?
- Are there dependencies or constraints related to legacy systems?
  
## Data classification and sensitivity
- What types of data are in scope (e.g., PII, PHI, CUI)?
- What is the appropriate FedRAMP impact level (Low, Moderate, High) for this data?
  
## System design and data architecture
- Where is the data now?
- How will data flow between and among systems and the SaaS solution?
- What are the data migration requirements and risks?
  
## Security and authorization
- Security is a foundational requirement, not an afterthought.
- What SaaS solutions that appear to meet the agency requirement have an existing FedRAMP authorization or a valid Agency Authorization to Operate (ATO)?
- If none, is the agency prepared to award a contract for a solution without existing authorization?
- What are the implications if authorization cannot be achieved during or after implementation?
  
## Records management and governance
- What are your records retention and access requirements?
- How will the SaaS provider support data export, archiving, and deletion?
- Are there requirements for auditing, version control, or chain of custody?
