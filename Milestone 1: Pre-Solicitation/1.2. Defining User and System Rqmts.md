# Define user, data, and system requirements
To get a secure and scalable SaaS solution, you must understand who will use the system, how it will integrate with existing infrastructure, and how it will manage and protect sensitive data.

## User access & scope
- How many users will need access?
- Will the solution be used by one agency or many agencies?
- What roles or permission levels are required?
  
## Integration and interoperability
- Can the SaaS integrate with your agencyâ€™s existing systems and workflows?
- What APIs, connectors, or data structures does it need?
- Are there dependencies or constraints related to legacy systems?
  
## Data classification and sensitivity
- What types of data are in scope (e.g., PII, PHI, CUI)?
- What is the appropriate FedRAMP impact level (low, moderate, high) for this data?
  
## System design and data architecture
- Where is the data now?
- How will data flow between and among systems and the SaaS solution?
- What are the data migration requirements and risks?
  
## Security and authorization
- Security is a foundational requirement, not an afterthought.
- What SaaS solutions that appear to meet the agency requirement have an existing FedRAMP authorization already or a valid Agency Authorization to Operate (ATO)?
- If none, is your agency prepared to award a contract for a solution without existing authorization?
- What are the implications if authorization cannot be achieved during or after implementation?
  
## Records management and governance
- What are your records retention and access requirements?
- How will the SaaS provider support data export, archiving, and deletion?
- Are there requirements for auditing, version control, or chain of custody?
