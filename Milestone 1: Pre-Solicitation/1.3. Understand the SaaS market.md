# Understand the SaaS market 
A well-informed market analysis helps determine if an off-the-shelf SaaS solution meets the agency’s needs or if the agency requires custom development.

Vendor demos show how each solution actually supports core agency workflows and can uncover issues not apparent in written requests for information or capability statements.

- **Use industry knowledge and peer experiences**
  - Engage in communities of practice (e.g., https://digital.gov/communities/ and https://www.cio.gov/about/members-and-leadership/cloud-infrastructure-cop/).
  - Consult agency cloud centers of excellence.
  - Learn from similar agencies' lessons learned and best practices.

- **Gather market intelligence**
  - Identify acquisition strategies used in successful procurements.
  - Research pricing models, volume discounts, and cost structures.

- **Conduct vendor demos**
  - Invite a shortlist of 3–5 vendors to demonstrate how their solutions meet core agency workflows. 
  - Include business users, IT staff, and cybersecurity reviewers in the sessions to evaluate technical fit, usability, and security posture.
  - Ask vendors to focus on showing must-have capabilities, not just polished sales features.
  - Allow time for Q&A and hands-on exploration, if possible, to get a deeper understanding of how the product performs in practice.
    
## Test before you invest
Test a SaaS solution to ensure it meets operational needs.

- **Assess integration capabilities**
  - Test with sample agency data to validate performance.
  - Evaluate usability and capability with core systems and workflows.

- **Get feedback from users**
  - Engage actual business users as well as IT subject matter experts to test and assess the SaaS in real-world scenarios
