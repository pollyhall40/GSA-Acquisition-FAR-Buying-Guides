# Buying Guide Content

There are two main ways you can contribute to the content for the Buying Guides on GitHub: **submitting an issue** and **forking the repository.** Whether you want to suggest a change or share an idea, your input is valuable! 

If you are not familiar with GitHub, we suggest Option 1.

## Option 1: Submitting an Issue (Provide general comments on the content)

Submit an issue...
- When you want to share feedback or suggest changes or general ideas that you think is important to be considered.
- When you want to propose draft sections or other high-level ideas based on your expertise or experience.
- When you want to point out small issues like typos or other errors that may not necessarily need a fork.

### When to Submit an Issue:
- You have a suggestion for improving the guide that requires more context than a pull request.
- You need clarification on something in the content.

### How to Submit an Issue:
1. **Go to the Issues Tab**
   - On the repository‚Äôs GitHub page, click the "Issues" tab.
  
2. **Click "New Issue"**
   - Click the green "New Issue" button.

3. **Describe Your Issue Clearly**
   - Provide a descriptive title.
   - Write a detailed explanation of the issue, including specific sections that need improvement.
   - If applicable, suggest alternative wording or structure.

4. **Submit the Issue**
   - Click "Submit new issue".

## Option 2: Forking the Content

Forking allows you to make direct contributions to the content by editing files, such as this `.MD` file. While it may seem complex at first, hopefully this guide makes it easier. We will do our best to continue improving these instructions.

### Steps to Fork and Contribute:
1. **Fork Our Acquisition-FAR-Buying-Guides Repository**
- Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.
- This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. **Don't forget to click "Sync Fork"  every so often to keep your copy up to date with ours.** You can find this button on the main page of your repository.

2. **Open the `.MD` File to Edit**
   - Navigate to your forked repository.
   - Locate the `.MD` file you want to update.
   - Click the file to open it, then select the "Edit" (pencil) icon.

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Edit the content directly in the GitHub web editor.
   - Ensure your updates improve clarity, or accuracy.

**Keep the change limited to one proposed change per pull request**

4. **Propose Your Changes**
   - Click the Green "Commit changes" button.

**Remember: Keep the change limited to one proposed change per pull request**

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - On the forked respository, click "Contribute" ‚Üí click "Open Pull Request"
   - Provide a descriptive title ‚Üí Ideally a quick scan should be enough to help someone categorize the intent of the issue‚Äôs content.
   - Provide enough details ‚Üí In the description, include specific details for the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind your feedback, and where relevant, the ‚Äúhow‚Äù to actually implement it.
  
6. **The Buying Guide Team will review the submission**
   - The team will work quickly to review comments as quickly as possible.
   - The team may choose to adopt or reject the change.
   - If you decide to change your mind, just return to your "Pull Requests" page and close the request.

By forking the repository or submitting issues, you help improve the content for everyone. Thank you for contributing!

# **Tips for Better Issues**

We want your feedback! To make the management of our issues something we can do quickly and effectively, here are some tips. Following these tips will help us make the most of your insight, allow us to address it directly, and improve our own work along the way.


## **For Users: Submitting a New Issue**

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ **Before You Submit - Run a Quick Search**

- Please do a quick search in the existing issues (both open and closed) to see if someone has already reported the same thing.
    
- You can add comments to an existing issue if it matches yours.
    
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Write Your Title - Use a User Story Format**

- This helps clearly state _who_ benefits, _what_ is needed, and _why_.
    
- As a {your role; e.g., vendor, contracting professional, member of the public}, I need {action or goal} so that {reason or benefit}.
    
- Example:
    
    - As a CO, I need the "Pilot deployment CLIN" to be 120 days so that we can test the tools' across two organizations
        
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Write Your Description**

- Be **specific**, clearly describe what page and section the change refers to.
    
- Explain why this change is important and what problem this solves.
    
- Add supporting detail, include examples, links, and references.
    
- Provide examples where the suggested update has proven successful in a procurement.
    
- Example:
    
    - I am referring to Milestone 2.1, Modular SaaS Procurements; under Example of Modular SaaS CLIN Structure, CLIN 0002.
        
    - I am a Contracting Officer for Agency and I manage their procurements across two unique sub-organizations. For Agency, having 30-120 days instead of 30-90 days would ensure the teams are able to test and configure the SaaS tool for the unique workflows and data requirements. The original timeline would not adequately support the time it would take to address our needs and could lead to adoption issues and inefficiencies during rollout. Additional time for testing would ensure better implementation and would minimize risk, something other agencies would also benefit from as evidenced from Tool Rollout at Other Agency.
        
    - LINK (e.g., press release, memo, blog, etc).
        
- Where applicable, provide actionable suggestions that would allow us to implement your input.
